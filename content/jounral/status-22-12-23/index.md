Way too much time has passed since the last post. The thing is: either you
write every week (a resonable time to have something to say) or you don't
write at all. Condensing everything that has happened in a month is
considerably more difficult;

Anyway, the language (now Étude) is starting to feel very good. Recently, I
have set up a gitea instance to color its source code. Also, I have been able
to write an IRC client in it, so that's nice.

Ok, let's leave it at that!
