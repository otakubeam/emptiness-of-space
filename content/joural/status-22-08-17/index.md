## So, what did I manage to accomplish this week?

### Functional Analysis 

This week I dove deeply into the Functional Analysis -- my final analytical
subject from university. The exam will be in ten days and I really cannot fail
it. 

### Git Annex

Following the notice that Phystech is going to get cut off from the Google
Suite for educational institutions, I was moving all my files to a different
location. Thankfully, I have been building my own infrastructure for this, so I
have at least a few terabytes of extra storage, not assigned to keeping
torrents alive. And at least several machines capable hosting that storage.

As my preferred storage solution I chose git annex. So far it's immensely
useful and something I wanted for some time but could not name. Read more in a [dedicated article](/wired/git-annex/)

#### No more hentai

In the process of moving I have actually deleted almost a terabyte of encrypted
hentai doujinshi from exhentai backups. While they are good to have, I
personally have no use for them; they cannot be easily decripted anyways.
Whatever!

### Francais

I started learning French with Michel Thomas again. The next semester I am
gonna have it in university. It's good and I feel am on my way to making some
real progress. Up to this point I have not **really** tried to learn french.
Just some on and off doodling. Let's see what I can do.

## Next week

I am probably going to Moscow again, we'll see to that. Otherwise I really need
to get this last exam over with.
