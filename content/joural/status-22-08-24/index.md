## So, what did I manage to accomplish this week?

This week I studied functional analysis and french.

I also moved to the campus again. Feels good.

I guess I need a way to compress the past status updates. 
It starts to feel cramped. Or maybe change to monthly updates?

## Next week

In two days I will have the exam. On verre...

Then I can finally focus on the compilers again. The thing about studying at
Phystech is that it wastes a lot of time.
