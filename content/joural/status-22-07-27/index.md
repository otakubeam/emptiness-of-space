# So, what did I manage to accomplish this week?

I had 3 tasks in mind:
  - *Crafting interpreters* 

    Make progress on the book and the accompanying implementation. This is
    where I have spent most of the week. Although I am making a stedy progress,
    I wish a could be faster and smarter. Learning something new can be very confusing. 
    A great thing is that I actually get to study different approaches and
    implementations.
    - Lox in other languages by different people
    - Harec 

      This one is actually really understanable and nice.

    - Java Andrew Appel

      This book has a lot of practical advice.
      There are also ML version. I am a bit intrigued.

    - Pavel Akhtyamov 
    - Rust
    - Lua and Luajit (a bit)

    Studying the implementation is very time consuming right now.
    I need to think of a better way to utilize my attention.
    It's just that 

  - Use css and style the site "emptiness-of-space"

    This is what I have been doing for the past two days. 
    I am really happy with the style I got. 
    It's even more minimal that it was,
    while still being nice to look at (for me)
    Moving the CSS from my previous setup was almost painless
    and I made a script to publish the gallery along with the site.
    Finally, I got https, for `white` and `blue` domains.
    One thing I still wish to do is to make a separate page for Books I am reading.

  - *Programming in Haskell*
    
    No progress here. I reasoned not good to fracture attention too much
    So I was foucused on inplementing interpreteres.

  - Keepers
    
    I am very happy to announce that since I did a big cleaning of my server it
    completely stopped freezing. I hope that marks the end of my problems with
    it. Now I can host all things leisurely.

  - Neovim
    
    I have also spent some time improving my config.
    Now it's mostly based on NvChad, 
    but the configuration is really good, so why not?


## What does the future hold for us?

For the next week I want to:
  - Continue implementing the interpreter

    Right now this is where I can get the most value.

  - Populate the wiki

    Don't forget to make quick documentation as I go

  - Generate html from my bookmarks (in the form of wiki)
