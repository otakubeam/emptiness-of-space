Some people spend their days like they are gonna live forever. Playing computer
games, binge watching tv or something. Aimlessly socializing.

That is no way to live. Such ephemeral existence lacks purpose. Of course, it's
not anyone's fault per se. It's just the way people are. We are born into a
meaningless world, after all. And it's our onw responsiility to figure out its
purpose. Or choose not to.

I am painfully aware that I will die. I fear death. But at the same time I want
**not** to fear death. I go out every day with the thought that I might as well
die today. And to be ok with that as much as possible. Reconciling yourself
with your own death takes courage, it's difficult.

I live my life such that every day counts. Every day I get something new,
become more of a man. And 

I will try to live a purposeful life and die without regret. Whenever that may
be. Ideally, on my own terms.

I am sorry if this sounds moralizing or arrogant. I just wanted to write down
these thoughts because I constantly seeing people like that. And some of them
ask me to live like them and keep it easy.  
Honestly, it's quite disturbing.
